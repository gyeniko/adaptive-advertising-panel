# Adaptive Advertising Panel

My goal was to create an adaptive advertising panel software.

The program can detects faces in webcam images and classifies them by gender, age and facial expression.  Based on the identified characteristics, it displays targeted advertisements. (ads_panel_v4.py)

This project includes an administration interface (ad_panel_controller_MainWindow.py) with these options:
* upload advertisements,
* configure the target groups for an ad,
* list the ads that have been uploaded,
* delete the advertisements.

I can't upload the keras models here because these files are too large. However, you can see how I trained the models in the Jupyter Notebooks folder.

Here is a demonstration video of the completed project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m9-JId1MlabbpvULMBxlA6_Dcrm07Pdp/view?usp=drive_link
